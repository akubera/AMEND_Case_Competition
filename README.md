client, Metal Working Group (MWG).
MWG runs a job shop specializing in various metal fabrication applications.
They have given us over 5 years of financial transaction data representing every single job
completed.
It is our job to find the important insights in the data and then **recommend the best actions
to maximize profit for the business**.

  - Profit / Revenue / Cost
  - of Customers
  - of Jobs Shipped
  - of Parts per Shipment
- 80 / 20 Pareto Analysis:
  - Which customers create the most revenue / cost?
  - Which parts drive the most revenue  / cost?
- Forecasts
- **MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DECISIONS**
  - Finance / Sales
  - Operations

The final deliverable is a PowerPoint Presentation detailing the key insights found and
recommendations for action.
